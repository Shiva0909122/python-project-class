# Pandas Overview

## Introduction
Pandas is an open-source Python library built on top of NumPy. It provides high-performance data structures and operations for numerical data and time series manipulation. Pandas is widely used for data importation, cleaning, transformation, and analysis.

## Key Features
- High-performance productivity for data analysis.
- Comprehensive tutorials covering basic to advanced data manipulation functions.
- Extensive functionality for working with different data types and formats.

## Core Topics
### 1. Data Structures
- Creating **DataFrames** and **Series**
- Viewing and converting data to NumPy arrays
- Indexing, selecting, and filtering data.


### 2. Data Manipulation
- Adding, deleting, and modifying columns and rows
- Truncating and reshaping DataFrames and Series
- Iterating through rows and columns
- Handling missing data and sorting techniques

### 3. Grouping and Combining Data
- `groupby` operations and aggregations
- Combining columns and dictionary-based grouping
- Merging, joining, and concatenating DataFrames and Series
- Appending rows and manipulating strings

### 4. Working with Date and Time
- Converting timestamps and datetime operations
- Creating fixed frequency datetime indexes

### 5. Text Data Manipulation
- Changing string cases
- Replacing values and pattern matching

### 6. File Handling
- Working with CSV and Excel files
- Loading and saving data efficiently
- Applying functions to DataFrame rows and elements

### 7. Data Aggregation and Visualization
- Using Pandas for aggregation functions
- Visualization techniques using Pandas and Seaborn
- Applying specific functions related to DataFrames, Series, datetime, and timedelta

## Installation
Pandas can be installed using: 

# pip install pandas

## Practice Projects
- **Analyzing Used Car Prices**
- **Converting CSV Files to HTML Tables**

Pandas is an essential library for data analysis in Python, providing powerful tools to manipulate and analyze structured data efficiently.
